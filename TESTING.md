## Code Validation

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

| Directory | File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | run.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfedyachkina/language-quiz/main/run.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/validation-python.png) | |

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Terminal | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-firefox.png) | Works as expected |
| Edge | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-edge.png) | Works as expected |


## Responsiveness


I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

| Device | Terminal | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/responsive-mobile.png) | Works as expected |
| Tablet (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/responsive-tablet.png) |  Works as expected |
| Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/responsive-desktop.png) | Works as expected |


## Lighthouse Audit


I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.

When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.

Repeat for all other tests, as applicable to your own site.
The aforementioned tests are just an example of a few different project scenarios.

## Bugs

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

This section is primarily used for JavaScript and Python applications,
but feel free to use this section to document any HTML/CSS bugs you might run into.

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

## Unfixed Bugs

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:
