## Features

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

## Data Model

### Flowchart

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created for the app's logic,
and mapped out before coding began using a free version of
[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) and/or [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io).

Below is the flowchart of the main process of this Python program. It shows the entire cycle of the program.

### Classes & Functions


The primary functions used on this application are:

- `get_username()`
    - Get a username from user.
- `validate_username()`
    - Validate if the user created the username which meets requirements.
- `user_action()`
    - Show options of actionns to the user and get a number of actiopn from user.
- `validate_user_action()`
    - Validate the input for action from user.
- `start_quiz()`
    - Show options of languages.
- `show_questions()`
    - Show the questions of the chosen language's quiz, gets the username's answers and calculate the score.
- `validate_answer()`
    -  Validate the user's inputs for quiz answers.
- `end_quiz()`
    -  Didplays the result of quiz.
- `add_score_to_score_sheet()`
    -  Add user's score to the score worksheet and ask a user if he would like to see the whole score table.
- `validate_score_answer()`
    -  Validate user's input for the question if he would like to see thw whole score table.
- `show_score()`
    -  Shows the whole score table.
- `exit_program()`
    -  Display bye message and and the program.
- `main()`
    - Run all program functions.

### Imports

I've used the following Python packages and/or external imported packages.

- `gspread`: used with the Google Sheets API
- `google.oauth2.service_account`: used for the Google Sheets API credentials

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser.
This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://language-quiz-8c94a99f5a81.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- If using any confidential credentials, such as CREDS.JSON, then these should be pasted in the Config Variables as well.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If using any confidential credentials, such as `CREDS.json` or `env.py` data, these will need to be manually added to your own newly created project as well.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dfedyachkina/language-quiz) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/dfedyachkina/language-quiz.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/dfedyachkina/language-quiz)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dfedyachkina/language-quiz)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
